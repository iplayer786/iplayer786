- 👋 Hi, I’m Altamish
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development, Software Engineering, and making the world a better place as a leader someday.
- 🌱 I just finished completing my ITSD program at SAIT as a 2nd generation Developer! Fun fact, I'm also a Business grad! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more projects. Career opportunies would also be amazing as I have a background in marketing, media, and now growing in tech!
